about,
      indexatfirst.html
                        Here we have not done anything , Just think about a card games where all the cards are been placed in a single place.
                         go to indexatfirst.
      indexatsecond.html
                       Here we have copied the same code but have added something like given top and left properties , here too the item 
                        comes one after the another
                        all the z-index is 0 by default  
      indexatthird.html
                       Here I have set the z-index value of image three as 1 , So that the images of the z-index comes infront of all the other images.
      Other things like 
                      Making z-index -1 would take it to the back relative to the other z-index

                     Make the z-index value as much as you want as it doesn't matter to the browser

       indexatfourth.html
                      Here I have included javascript event handler where onclick the image will come at the top
